# Starting

App can be run locally

Install requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To start application on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ go to the directory with `manage.py` file
(`cd project`) and run

`./manage.py runserver`

Running tests works as usual for django application:

`./manage.py tets`

## Building and running docker image

**TO BE IMPLEMENTED**

# Notes

* No authentication or authorization implemented.
* No docker support yet
* Checking for number of occupied rooms for each day is highly ineffective and the biggest concern.
